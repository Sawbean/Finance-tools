      <p>Efficient loan management begins with understanding your monthly installment or <strong>EMI (Equated Monthly Installment)</strong>. Using an EMI calculator ensures accurate calculations, saves time, and allows you to plan your finances wisely.</p>
      
      <h2>What is EMI?</h2>
      <p>EMI is the fixed monthly payment that a borrower makes to a lender for repaying a loan over a specific period. Each EMI consists of both <strong>principal</strong> and <strong>interest</strong> components.</p>

      <h2>How EMI is Calculated?</h2>
      <p>The EMI is calculated using the formula:</p>
      <p><em>EMI = [P x R x (1+R)^N] / [(1+R)^N – 1]</em></p>
      <p>Where:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>P</strong> = Principal loan amount</li>
        <li><strong>R</strong> = Monthly interest rate (annual rate ÷ 12 ÷ 100)</li>
        <li><strong>N</strong> = Number of monthly installments (years × 12)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Benefits of Using an EMI Calculator</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Instant calculation of monthly payments.</li>
        <li>Compare different loan options.</li>
        <li>Plan your budget effectively.</li>
        <li>Understand how interest impacts your total payment.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>Enter your loan amount.</li>
        <li>Input the annual interest rate.</li>

      </ol>
